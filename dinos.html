                        The Tyrannosaurus Rex, or T-Rex, is one of the most powerful predators to ever walk the earth. Famous for its massive size, huge jaws, and tiny arms, the T-Rex is often referred to as the king of the dinosaurs.

                        Though much smaller than the T-Rex, the Velociraptor is a highly intelligent and cunning hunter. They hunt in packs and are known for their incredible speed and deadly sickle-shaped claw on each foot.

                        A peaceful herbivore, the Triceratops is easily recognizable by its three horns and large bony frill. These features are not just for looksâ€”they're used for defense against predators like the T-Rex!

                        This massive herbivore is known for its extremely long neck and front legs, which were longer than its back legs. They were among the tallest dinosaurs and often ate from the tops of trees.
                    </p>

                        A small, carnivorous dinosaur with two bony crests on its head. In the movies, it is famously known for its neck frill and ability to spit venom, though this is not scientifically accurate.

                        Easily recognized by the large sail on its back, the Spinosaurus was an enormous predator, even larger than the T-Rex. It was a semi-aquatic dinosaur that primarily hunted fish.

                        A large flying reptile, not technically a dinosaur, with a bony crest on its head. Pteranodons soared through the skies and used their long beaks to catch fish.

                        These tiny, chicken-sized dinosaurs hunted in large groups, or packs. Their small size and speed made them a threat in large numbers, often overwhelming their prey.

                        This herbivore is known for its distinctive, long, curved crest on its head. Scientists believe this crest may have been used for communication, allowing them to make loud, low-frequency sounds.
